# Essential description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has one or a few cash registers 
EZShop is a software application to:
* manage sales
* manage inventory
* manage customers
* support accounting



# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|   Stakeholder x..     |             | 

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram
\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>
```plantuml
@startuml


title Context Diagram


actor Owner

actor Product
actor Subscriber
actor Employee
actor :Card printer: as cardPrinter
actor :Inventory and Catalogue System: as IandCS
rectangle "EZShop System" as EZShopSystem{
(EZShop)
}
Subscriber --> EZShop
Owner -|> Subscriber
Employee -|>Subscriber
Product --> EZShop
EZShop <-- cardPrinter
IandCS -> EZShop


@enduml
```

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces
\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|   Actor x..     |  |  |

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>


# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  FR1     |  |
|  FR2     |   |
| FRx..  | | 

## Non Functional Requirements

\<Describe constraints on functional requirements>

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, ..)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     |   |  | |
|  NFR2     | |  | |
|  NFR3     | | | |
| NFRx .. | | | | 


# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |  
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other executions, ex in case of errors> |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished> |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     |  |  
|  2     |  |
|  ...     |  |

##### Scenario 1.2

##### Scenario 1.x

### Use case 2, UC2
..

### Use case x, UCx
..
